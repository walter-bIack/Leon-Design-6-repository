**Description:** For this lab, we were tasked with using setting up and expereimenting with how the blockchain works using snakecoin.py and running it on a website.

Running hash_value.py
--
For values 1, 1.0, and 3.14 the py hash stayed the same for both runs. But for a tuple of vowels and an object of person the hashes were different in each run.
